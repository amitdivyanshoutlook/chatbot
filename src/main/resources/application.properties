Then explain it in a few short Hindi steps like you're talking to an 18-year-old student from India who speaks Hindi at home. Use no big words. Keep total length under 70 words."
aadhya.eduverse.prompt2 = "Now, explain it to me like I?m 10 years old. Use a simple story or analogy I can understand. Imagine I?m young who only speaks Hindi at home. Break it down like you?re telling a story from real life. If it helps, mix Hindi and English so it feels like how elders explain to kids in India. No big words. Make it clear."
